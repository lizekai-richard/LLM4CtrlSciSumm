Forexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-right architecture, where every token can only at-tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layersof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-strictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,and could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-tuning based approaches to token-level tasks suchas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-porate context from both directions. In this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning basedapproaches by proposing BERT: BidirectionalEncoder Representationsfrom Transformers.BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-rectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-guage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-spired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). Themasked language model randomly masks some ofthe tokens from the input, and the objective is topredict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-right language model pre-training, the MLM ob-jective enables the representation to fuse the leftand the right context, which allows us to pre-In addi-train a deep bidirectional Transformer.tion to the masked language model, we also usea “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-trains text-pair representations. The contributionsof our paper are as follows: • We demonstrate the importance of bidirectionalpre-training for language representations. Un-like Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-tional language models for pre-training, BERTuses masked language models to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. Thisis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), whichuses a shallow concatenation of independentlytrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs. • We show that pre-trained representations reducethe need for many heavily-engineered task-speciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-tuning based representation model that achievesstate-of-the-art performance on a large suiteof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-forming many task-speciﬁc architectures. • BERT advances the state of the art for elevenNLP tasks.
